This folder holds projects for potential space stage "campaigns" that utilizea hidden functionality in space stage missions: Ability to "chain" archetype missions together. Maxis' own adventures that come with the game always take priority, but after that you can have your captain take on any sorts of adventures that either do or don't continue the narrative set by the original Maxis archetype adventure.

Here are some ideas for campaign mods surrounding some adventures I feel could work well.
